# Optimizing Employee Retention Prediction through HR Data Cleansing and Feature Engineering

**Overview:**

This project focuses on improving the accuracy of employee retention prediction models by meticulously cleaning and preparing messy HR data.  The analysis involves identifying and handling missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers within the dataset.  Through effective data cleansing and feature engineering, we aim to create a refined dataset suitable for building robust and accurate predictive models, ultimately enabling proactive interventions to reduce employee turnover costs.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (potentially, depending on model building included)


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`


**Example Output:**

The script will print key statistics and insights regarding the data cleaning process to the console.  This includes summaries of missing data, the methods used to handle it, and any transformations applied to features.  Additionally, the script may generate visualizations (e.g., plots showing the distribution of key variables before and after cleaning) which will be saved as image files (e.g., `data_distribution_before.png`, `data_distribution_after.png`) in the `output` directory.  The exact output will depend on the specific analyses performed within `main.py`.

**Directory Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the raw HR data (this directory may not be included in the initial commit if data is sensitive or large).
* `src/`: Contains the source code for data cleaning and preparation.
* `notebooks/`:  (Optional) Jupyter Notebooks with more detailed exploratory data analysis.
* `output/`: Contains generated plots and other output files.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists project dependencies.
